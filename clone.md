Cloning is the process of creating a local version of a remote repository on your personal computer. Unlike a simple file download, a clone includes the entire project history, all branches, and the version control metadata. Under the hood, Git initializes a new directory, creates a .git hidden folder, downloads all the data from the remote URL, and sets up tracking so your computer knows exactly how to sync with the server in the future.
