The Pull command is used to fetch and download content from a remote repository and immediately update your local files to match that content. It is the primary way to stay up-to-date with work that others have pushed to the server. Technically, a git pull is a combination of two steps: git fetch (which gets the data) followed by git merge (which integrates that data into your current working branch)
