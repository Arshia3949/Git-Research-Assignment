A Pull Request is a collaboration feature unique to platforms like GitHub, rather than a direct Git command. It is a formal proposal to merge your changes from one branch (or fork) into the main branch of the original repository. It creates a dedicated space for team members to review the code, discuss improvements, and ensure everything works correctly before the code is officially accepted
