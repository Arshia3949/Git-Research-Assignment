These three actions represent the flow of data in a collaborative environment. Push is used to upload your local commits to the remote server. Pull is the act of downloading changes from the server to your local machine. Pull Request is a social and administrative step that happens entirely on the website, where you ask the project owners to review and "pull" your changes into their project.
