When you Fork, GitHub performs a server-side operation that duplicates the repository's database objects (commits, trees, and blobs) within its own infrastructure, linking your new copy to the original to track relationship history. When you Clone, your local Git client communicates with the server to download the entire compressed history of the project; it then decompressses this data into the .git folder and "checks out" the files into your directory so they are ready for editing
